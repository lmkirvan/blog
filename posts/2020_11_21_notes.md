##### A backlog of notes, from a few weeks without a computer.

I've been emailing myself "notes" from my phone. Actually a pretty nice way to not lose hold of thoughts.

This is from reading "contingency, irony, solidarity":

*Final vocabularies (neopragmatist community based ways of speaking) depend on institutions. as institutions falter, truth falters.*

This seems self-evidently true. To spool it out a bit, I guess that the vocabularies become less final--the institutions lose their ability to speak. Or, they speak less clearly and less definitively. 

*Obviously the people who benefit most from assigning markets the role of valuation of everything are rich people.* and *Markets maximize expediency and efficiency with the two trading off.*

This pair is not really interesting, but maybe the pairing is. I think that the price mechanism makes a lot of sense. But the trade off between what gets produced and how it gets produced (the externalities) depends on the perogatives of the wealthy--especially when they control the levers of state.
