### Sandel LSE lecture on his book about meritocracy 

negative aspect to meritocracy--includes an implied failure on the part of those that don't succeed. Virtue ethical perspective? A form of hubris damages the successful and the implication that failing to succeed indicates personal failings. Meritocracy is seductive, but ultimately degrades it's embedding. 

Arguments motivated by virtues require some embedding--does this make them conservative by their nature--i.e. more likely about preserving than reforming or changing?

Also listened to the lecture about the new Angus Deaton book --> he emphasizes the loss of dignity specifically for those without a post-secondary education.
