Spotted these fragile stink-horns growing in abundance underneath a stand of banana trees. Like most stinkhorns they earn their family name ("	Phallaceae"), although they aren't nearly x-rated like the devil's stinkhorn.

They have a super fragile and insubstantial stipe. It's like fortune cookie dough rolled out extra thin.  You can see it pretty clearly in this picture.
